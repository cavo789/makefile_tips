# Getting information's from the .env file

Getting a value from a `.env` file is easy, just include it then use variables:

```env
DOCKER_IMAGE=cavo789/my_image
```

```makefile
include .env

helloDocker:
	@echo "The name of the image is ${DOCKER_IMAGE}"
```

This `include` tip will works with any file defining a variable and his value

We can perfectly have a file called `Make.config`, not `.env`
